The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word.In most variants, proper nouns, such as names,
places, and brands, are not allowed. Slang words, sometimes referred to as informal or shortened words, are also not allowed. If the 
guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested 
letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.

The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word.[citation needed] If the word is correct, the game is over
and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. On the other 
hand, if the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time 
with the guesser losing. However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing the 
word, before the diagram is completed.

# Strategy

The fact that the twelve most commonly occurring letters in the English language are e-t-a-o-i-n-s-h-r-d-l-u (from most to least), along with other letter-frequency lists, are used by the guessing player to increase the odds when it is their turn to guess. On the other hand, the same lists can be used by the puzzle setter to stump their opponent by choosing a word that deliberately avoids common letters (e.g. rhythm or zephyr) or one that contains rare letters (e.g. jazz).

Another common strategy is to guess vowels first, as English only has five vowels (a, e, i, o, and u, while y may sometimes, but rarely, be used as a vowel) and almost every word has at least one.

According to a 2010 study conducted by Jon McLoone for Wolfram Research, the most difficult words to guess include jazz, buzz, hajj, faff, fizz, fuzz and variations of these.
